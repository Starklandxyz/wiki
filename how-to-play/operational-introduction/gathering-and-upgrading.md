# ‚õè Gathering and Upgrading

The status bar on the right side displays the resources and land plots owned by the player. You can unlock more land plot limits by upgrading your base. Resources will not automatically enter the player's account; players need to click the "Claim" button to extract resources.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the player does not extract the resources, they will lose the resources stored on the current plot of land when it is attacked.
{% endhint %}
