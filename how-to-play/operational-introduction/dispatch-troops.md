# ðŸ’‚â™€ Dispatch Troops

Dispatching troops to occupy land is a key aspect of the game. The prerequisite for constructing any building is to possess the territory. Thus, dispatching troops to occupy land is the first step in all actions.

1. Select any plot of land and check the number of warriors on it.
